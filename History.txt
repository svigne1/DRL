1. It took me 45 pages of work to get convinced Sergey's steps are wrong but results are right for the imitation learning's proof. A total of 5 days i spent on the maths.
2. It took me 20 pages of work, but i couldn't prove baseline as a function of state or time is also unbiased in expectation. In the end, i had to google up the answer, found a blog where the math was horrbile and unreadable, but i got the answer from there. I feel ashamed that i cud have never seen that fact hidden among the equations.
